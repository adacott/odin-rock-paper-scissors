# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is the beginning of the project for the odin project that starts the rock, paper, scissors game. Here, I demonstrate 
knowledge of basic javscript syntax and functions, creating three functions to simulate playing a game of rock-paper-scissors
against a computer opponent.
