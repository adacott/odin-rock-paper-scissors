This is the beginning of the project for the odin project that starts the rock, paper, scissors game. Here, I demonstrate 
knowledge of basic javscript syntax and functions, creating three functions to simulate playing a game of rock-paper-scissors
against a computer opponent.

In the most recent updates, a feature branch was merged to main that adds a UI for the player to see and keep track of the score. This demonstrates use of javscript, css, and html. Particularly is deals with proficiency in creating and rearranging a webpage in html and css, and then manipulation DOM elements with javascript to create a game of rock paper scissors.
